<h4>How to use:</h4>
<p class="instructions">This site creates spreadsheets for your potential summoning pairs given a hero you own and a list of heroes you could potentially summon with it. Proper use of this site will let you quickly see which summoning candidates will give you the best results and for what cost allowing you to make the best value decisions possible on every summon.</p>
<p class="instructions">Gather the following information about your hero and the summoning candidates you would like to summon with so you can fill out the data entry form:</p>
<li class="instructions">hero number as shown on the bottom of the front of the hero card</li>
<li class="instructions">the realm the hero came from also on the bottom of the front of the hero card</li>
<li class="instructions">the summoning cost + hire price needed to use the hero for the summon</li>
<p class="instructions">Once the needed information is gathered go back to the home page, click the Generate Summoning Sheet link, enter the information in the provided forms and then click the Create Summoner Sheet button. The forms will take a single your hero number, and your hero cost but will take multiple hero numbers and costs for hero candidates. The site will then show you your summoning data in a table in the following column order:</p>
<p class="instructions">hero number, summoning cost, profession odds, purple stat odds, blue stat odds, green stat odds, wanted class odds, indifferent class odds, other class odds, rarity odds</p>
<p class="instructions">Starting with profession odds these stats are given in order of importance. Profession is the most important thing to pass because of the stamina efficiency a hero gains when doing it's main profession. Following this in importance is passing a blue stat which is also optimum for that profession. The hero class is third but still important as each class has higher growth percentages on some stats rather than others making certain classes superior for certain professions. </p>
<p class="instructions">Passing the correct profession also tends to make failed summons less severe. As an example let's say we have a Warrior class hero, with Blue Strength that has Mining profession. Let's assume we have a failed summon and pass the Warrior class but end up with a Gardener. Even if we pass the intended blue stat this is a horrible result. We will never be able to sell this hero for anything near what we summoned it for, it will make a bad Miner because of the stamina inefficiency of having the hero do a different profession than it's main profession. This also wastes any stat boosting stone we may have used. It will never make a good Gardener, and the hero's remaining summons are pretty much worthless. Instead let's say our failed summon passes the correct profession and blue stat but we end up with a Pirate class. This hero is far from being what we were going for however it will still mine at a profit and will have better returns over time than the previous example especially if we used a summoning stone for the summon. We may also be able to hire out some of it's summons to someone looking to make a Mining Ninja absorbing some of the cost we put into the summon. If we decide to sell this hero we also will likely absorb a smaller loss than a hero with a profession that doesn't match it's stats or class.</p>
<p class="instructions">I would also like to point out that while it is difficult to see large differences in passing the odds of a mutation or rarity there will be large differences in both the Profession and Blue Stat Odds being passed from candidate to candidate. You may see a 30% difference in the odds of passing a wanted purple stat for example however you will rarely see over a 2% difference in passing a class mutation or a 7% difference in passing higher than a common rarity from candidate to candidate.</p>
