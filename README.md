# DFK-SummoningSheet

The purpose of this project is to create a website that will provide you the summoning data for your hero and all the heros you could summon with that hero to get a side by side comparisson to find the best possible summon for that hero as opposed to only being able to see the data for one summon at a time.
While the front end is not built yet the data can be written to .csv spreadsheets to very powerful effect. I

In the first commit:

- README.md
- Functional back end that can retrieve data needed from the api
1. summoning_stat_calculations.py
2. gene_class.py

Things to come:
- Refined backend
- Front end code

Things that might come:
-methods to write .csv spreadsheets with data if front end takes longer than expected
